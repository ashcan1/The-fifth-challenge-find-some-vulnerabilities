Learn what Nikto is and how it works

Nikto is a free software command-line vulnerability scanner that scans webservers for dangerous files/CGIs,
 outdated server software and other problems. It performs generic and server type specific checks.
 It also captures and prints any cookies received

 b) Use Nikto on Kali Linux to scan the OWASP BWA machine
c) Note each of the alerts given
d) Research the alerts that you noted and explain why they are listed

+ The anti-clickjacking X-Frame-Options header is not present.

The server didn't return an X-Frame-Options header which means that this website could be at risk of a clickjacking attack. 
The X-Frame-Options HTTP response header can be used to indicate whether or not a browser should be allowed to render a page inside a frame or iframe.

The X-XSS-Protection header is not defined. This header can hint to the user agent to protect against some forms 

The HTTP X-XSS-Protection response header is a feature of Internet Explorer, 
Chrome and Safari that stops pages from loading when they detect reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks

+ The X-Content-Type-Options header is not set. This could allow the user agent to
 render the content of the site in

 This header prevents "mime" based attacks.
  This header prevents Internet Explorer from MIME-sniffing a response away from the declared content-type
   as the header instructs the browser not to override the response content type. With the nosniff option,
    if the server says the content is text/html,
    the browser will render it as text/html.

f) Start a scan job for the OWASP BWA machine in OpenVAS
g) What results differ from Nikto? Explain them.

the first thing that I noticed was UI shows more informationas than nikto for example : severity in opanvas is red when scanin owasb
I had more results in openvas than nikto 106 vulnerability high to medium
I have acces to report of each vulnerability
for example : summary, detection resualt,impact and even solution 
we can also save the report as a pdf etc.. 
 
 from stackoverflow : 
 Nikto is a web security tool which majorly looks for outdated software, dangerous files/CGI etc. Many of the modern scanners including Nessus, Openvas use Nikto to get information for their analysis (These tools have Nikto plugins).

Also, there are some cases where Nikto provides too many false positives compared to other Tools. Its always good to run multiple tools to see which tool reports relevant issues for your product.

Bottomline: Nikto is one of the powerful tools which can be used for reconnaissance. But should be analyzed properly before finalizing on the data reported
